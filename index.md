## About

I am a Research Scientist at **[Mysten Labs](https://mystenlabs.com/)** working on Blockchains, Applied Cryptography and Distributed Computing. Before that I was a Research Scientist at **[Facebook](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/eleftherios-kokoris-kogias-52836274)** and an Assistant Professor at **[IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/)**.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from **[EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/eleftherios.kokoriskogias?lang=en)**,
and my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the **[National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en)**.

## Research

I am interested in increasing the digital trust of online information and processes, especially those that impact the physical world.
I am working on building a scalable and robust infrastructure for the future decentralised internet focusing on scalable blockchain systems, bias-resistant decentralised randomness generation, secure software update dispersion and novel applications of threshold cryptography and distributed consensus.
